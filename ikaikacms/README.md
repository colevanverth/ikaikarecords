This contains the [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) CMS to manage Ikaika Records "services" and "out now music". 

## Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies:
   * [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Run `npm i`. 
3. Run `npm run strapi develop`.

## Notes 
* The development database is seperate from the production database, which is hosted on Railway.
* Assets such as images are stored in Cloudinary and not the database; however, Strapi is configured to [automatically integrate asset uploads with Cloudinary](https://strapi.io/blog/add-cloudinary-support-to-your-strapi-application). 
* [This article](https://dev.to/yinks/how-to-create-and-deploy-a-strapi-project-on-railway-3kja) is invaluable for understanding how to set up Strapi to be hosted on Railway.
