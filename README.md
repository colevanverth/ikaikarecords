## File Structure

The file structure is as follows:

- `./ikaikacms` - Strapi CMS.
- `./ikaikawebsite` - NextJS app utilizing React comprising the front-end of the website and an API that interfaces with two integrations (see below).
- `./ikaikalogo` - Contains all the logo variations of the Ikaika Records LLC logo, including Illustrator files and font.

## Hosting

- The front-end, content-managment system, and database are hosted through [Railway](https://railway.app/). Any push to `master` triggers a redeploy for all components of the app.

  - **Notes**: Utilizes free SendGrid account which provides 100 free emails per day.
